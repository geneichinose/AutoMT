This package includes:

	1. AutoMT Automated Moment Tensor Inversion 
		(requires mtinv version 4.0) available at:
		https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtinv/

	2. getdata (uses curl to get data from iris using webservices 

	3. xml2sacpaz (converts StationXML Level=response to sacpz)
	
Of course items 2 and 3 were originally part of AutoMT but were popular enough to
 be separated out as individual apps
